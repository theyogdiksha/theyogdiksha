    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Namaste 🙏 I am a certified yoga teacher and a National Rifle Shooter. My journey has been shaped by two worlds—the discipline and focus of sports and the depth and wisdom of yoga. This unique blend allows me to guide people in building not only physical strength but also clarity of mind and inner resilience.</p>
    <p>With over 3 years of teaching experience, I have explored yoga as a path of healing, balance, and transformation. My teaching style integrates traditional yoga practices with modern awareness, creating sessions that are both grounding and empowering. Whether it is through mindful movement, breathwork, or meditation, my aim is to help individuals connect with their true self.</p>
    <p>I work with people of all ages and backgrounds, offering personalized one-on-one sessions as well as group classes to create a supportive and welcoming space. My mission is to inspire others to cultivate harmony in body, mind, and spirit—both on and off the mat.</p>
